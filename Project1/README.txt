Summary: Handles making tokens out of int type, print, random, ID's, literal
ints (I assume this include octal and hexadecimal), single character
operators, compound math operatos, comparison operators, boolean operators,
whitespace, comments (INCLUDING C-Style comments) and handles unknowns in the
specified manner. It also prints out the line count at the end, assuming no
error happened first.
