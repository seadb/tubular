IMPLEMENTING SCOPE INTO THE SYMBOL TABLE(S)

bison will detect a blocks

one way:
  encounters {
    create new symbol table
    encounters }
      move that symbol table into a vector of discared symbol tables
        How will we keep track of which symbol table belongs to what???
        -- member variable for each "astnode block' that holds the symbol tables
        -- problem: we need to be able to check other symbol tables for globall declared variables, or variables declared within a a block that contains the current block ie:
        int var = 4;
        if(true){
          var = 0;
          int a = 2;
          if (true){
            a = 3;
          }
        }
